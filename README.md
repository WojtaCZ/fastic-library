# FastIC+ library
This C++ library is intended to simplify the development of projects with the FastIC+ chips. It contains routines for receiving, syncing and descrambling the Aurora stream as well as description of the FastIC+ specific packets. Examples of practical use can be seen in the [FastIC+ readout](https://github.com/WojtaCZ/fastic-readout-fw) project.
